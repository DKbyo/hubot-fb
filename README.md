# hubot-fb
A (quick and dirty) Hubot adapter for the [Facebook Messenger Platform](https://messengerplatform.fb.com/).

See [Facebook's quickstart](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) for setup instructions on Facebook's side.

You need to set a config/environment variable called ```FB_PAGE_TOKEN``` containing your API token.
